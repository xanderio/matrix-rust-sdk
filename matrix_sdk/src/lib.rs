//! This crate implements a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) client library.
//!
//! # Enabling logging
//!
//! Users of the matrix-sdk crate can enable log output by depending on the
//! `tracing-subscriber` crate and including the following line in their
//! application (e.g. at the start of `main`):
//!
//! ```rust
//! tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();
//! ```
//!
//! The log output is controlled via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable by
//! setting it to one of the `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace` levels.
//! The output is printed to stdout.
//!
//! The `RUST_LOG` variable also supports a more advanced syntax for filtering
//! log output more precisely, for instance with crate-level granularity. For
//! more information on this, check out the [tracing_subscriber
//! documentation](https://tracing.rs/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.envfilter).
//!
//! # Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate feature flags are available:
//!
//! * `encryption`: Enables end-to-end encryption support in the library.
//! * `sled_cryptostore`: Enables a Sled based store for the encryption
//! keys. If this is disabled and `encryption` support is enabled the keys will
//! by default be stored only in memory and thus lost after the client is
//! destroyed.
//! * `markdown`: Support for sending markdown formatted messages.
//! * `socks`: Enables SOCKS support in reqwest, the default HTTP client.
//! * `sso_login`: Enables SSO login with a local http server.
//! * `require_auth_for_profile_requests`: Whether to send the access token in
//!   the authentication
//! header when calling endpoints that retrieve profile data. This matches the
//! synapse configuration `require_auth_for_profile_requests`. Enabled by
//! default.
//! * `appservice`: Enables low-level appservice functionality. For an
//!   high-level API there's the `matrix-sdk-appservice` crate
